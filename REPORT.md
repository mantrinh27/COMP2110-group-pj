Details of Deployment

The project which has been deployed is the same project outlined in Assignment 2 which is a COMP2110 Task Manager website. The website includes features revolving around task cards and widgets some of which include an emotion widget, a calendar widget, and a task timer widget. The deployment can be accessed from the URL: https://comp2110-group43.netlify.app/. The project has been deployed using Netlify allowing anyone who can access the URL to access the project granted they are able to log in. More details and documentation regarding the deployment, and future updates can be found below.

Deployment Process

As stated in the above paragraph, we decided to use Netlify for deploying our project. This is due to the simplicity of the drag-and-drop application which allowed us to deploy our application extremely fast and effectively. To deploy our application, we followed the steps outlined in the https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop “Drag and Drop Deploys on Netlify” documentation page. We were forced to use the drag and drop method as the alternative method of linking to a GitHub repository is not possible as our application is stored on a private repository. After the initial deployment, there were concerns that the deployment could have caused some errors in the project. This lead us to further investigate this potential issue by looking into how Netlify deployments work more in depth and also rechecking that all of our functions work in the deployed version of the project. Finally after investigating, we concluded that the deployment did not cause any errors in our project.

Updating Deployed Application

As stated earlier, unfortunately it is impossible to to link to the repository on Netlify as this feature is only available for public repositories. Instead we used the drag and drop deployment. Although this method makes it easier to initially deploy the project, it complicates the process of updating the deployment as it is not linked to github repository and is instead a copy of a group members local repository. As the deployment itself is being completely stored and hosted on Netlify servers, group members are unable to use their current local repositories to make changes/update as the deployment is a version of the project entirely independent of Github and local repositories. To make changes to the deployed version of the project, group members need to create a Netlify account and request access to the project. Once access is granted, they are able to view the project on the Netlify servers that correspond to the current deployment. Similarly to Github, to edit or update the current deployment files, group members are able to make a local copy of the project on their own devices and push/override the current deployment files, or edit the deployment files directly in the Site configuration tab which they have access to. Updates on local versions of the deployed project are not automatically pushed to the deployed version. A user must manually push or replace the files themself. 


What you achieved:

In this group project, we work as a team to complete a Task Management application where we apply our coding knowledge and web technologies knowledge to develop a task management application allowing users to view and organise their to-do tasks. Each of the team members is responsible for the design and the extension of the application, this includes implementing the page widgets, extending the task-card component.
Liam Ramsay worked on the functionality expansion of the task card by adding an option to edit task details and a pop-up display for selected tasks along with an overall appearance change. And the widgets are implemented by other team members.

Our first widget on the page is the Mood Widget. It was implemented by Thanh Man Trinh. The Mood widget allows the user to select their mood for the day from a list of emotional icons, with updating text representative of the selected mood.

Our second widget is the Calendar Widget completed by Nicholas Cavanaugh. The Calendar widget displays the calendar of the current date and month. The calendar also displays when each task is due, and highlights each task’s urgency with a specific color - green for complete, orange for todo, and red for urgent or task is overdue. The calendar also features buttons to navigate to previous or future months. 

Liam Cook implemented the third widget on the task application page which is the Task Timer Widget. It allows the user to start a countdown timer. The widget has three entry fields, for the Hours, Minutes and Seconds respectively, where the user can enter how long they want the timer to countdown for. There also consists three buttons, one to start the timer, one to pause the timer, and one to clear and reset the current timer.

Finally, we finished everything off by establishing a consistent style and colour scheme for the entire site. The final style of our site took heavy inspiration from one of our group member’s CSS project as we liked their choice in colour scheme, spacing and general layout. 


What did you find challenging:

All of us had different schedules and circumstances throughout the duration of the project. This led to a lot of gaps in communication at times as due to the limited timeframe of face-to-face interactions with our group members in our practical classes, we initially struggled to communicate with group members and organise the project properly. Luckily we recognised this relatively early on in the project which gave us an appropriate amount of time to find a solution for this issue. Our solution was to create an online group chat with our team members, allowing us to easily and efficiently communicate with one another.

Another part our group found challenging about this project was that whenever we were working on the same file at the same time, we had to worry about pushing our changes to the Github branch and causing merge conflicts to occur. There were several times when two members had made a change to a file and then pushed, without pulling a change that the other member had made moments before, causing a merge conflict to arise. Although this would be a massive challenge to solve if it had been a major overhaul of a file, in most cases it was just a lines difference which was easily resolved through clear communication in our online group chat. Despite this easy solution, it still caused a lot of delay and workflow disruption for our group when multiple members were active at the same time, especially towards the end of the project when we were making changes to each other's files. 

Finally, another part our group found challenging about this project was finding bugs in each other’s’ components of the project. To ensure that each member was writing code at a high enough standard to produce a user-friendly and functional project, each member of the group would vigorously test and assess each other's components to try and break them or find bugs. This was difficult not just for those testing the bugs, but to those facing criticism and needing to fix the discovered bugs. This not only forced group members to write higher quality code, but also gave group members confidence that after group members had tested their component, there were no other bugs included in the final design once submitted.


What was rewarding:

Being able to strengthen our group's understanding of how different languages communicate with each other across files and functions was something that allowed us to greatly improve our skills and understanding of the content throughout the unit and project. For example, the process regarding how JavaScript files call upon other JavaScript files allowed us to better plan out and diversify what was included in each file. For instance, instead of having CSS included inside our HTML or Javascript files, we decided to dedicate a file specifically for CSS which allowed us to call upon that file when necessary which allowed us to simplify the structure of our project considerably. This streamlined the development of the project as it simplified the structure, allowing other group members to easily understand, and add to the current code.

Another point to mention is that the idea of being given a blank template site and basic descriptions of each widget’s functionality allowed us to properly go from zero-to-hero and truly test our skills. We could approach each aspect of the site however we wanted, we could bounce ideas off of each other and we had room for trial and error to see what we did like and iterate on what needed to be improved. Being given such creative freedom was very fun and engaging, which in turn created the perfect learning environment for us to apply our knowledge as well as made us push the bounds of what we could achieve and to expand our knowledge. Like paint being applied to a blank canvas, our final product is like a reflection of what we’ve learnt thus far.


Individual reflection:

Liam Ramsay
For my part of the project, I decided to work on extending both the appearance and functionality of the task cards. I decided on this because as the core of the project, the task cards can’t be left as they originally were and also because the additions to be made were more appealing to me. The functions of editing task details and adding a pop-up display were very interesting compared to some of the widgets and what was expected of them.

For me, the most challenging part of the project was the implementation of the pop-up display. There were many reasons for this and they included the functions’ interaction with the rest of the project (mostly the tasks but also on the page as a whole) and also the knowledge I had to gain to implement the function. My pop-up display uses the asyncronisation function of JavaScript to load all of the selected data from a clicked task and then display that data in a designated form that is placed on the top layer of the page. This function is a considerable step up from adding text boxes and updating data using the edit button of the tasks as it involves a more intricate and real-time style of data capturing. 

Another issue I faced in the development and improvement of my part of the project was the interaction that my pop-up function had with the other functions. When I initially implemented the pop-up function, the display seemed to duplicate, once inside the task card’s border and once again in the middle of the screen, as intended. It took me some time to fix this issue as I had to rearrange my code so that the function only had access to the encapsulated data it required to display correctly, due to this I had to move a lot of my code from one file to another so that the proper isolation was made.

I decided to implement the task timer widget into the project. I chose this widget because I recognised the value of the widget regarding how it could improve and strengthen my ability to utilize the core principles revolving around Javascript, HTML, and CSS and combine them into a functional and aesthetically pleasing task timer widget. Due to the simplicity of the widget, I managed to get a working prototype of my widget reasonably soon. The most challenging part of the project was finding and fixing bugs in my widget. Due to the large amount of variables in my widget, this allowed for a large amount of room for bugs to emerge, most of which appeared under strict circumstances. After every fix, I vigorously tested input values to check for bugs. This included values above the expected field, below, inside. I not only had to do this for one input field, but 3. This process was quite time-consuming and tedious but proved to be effective. Using this process, I was able to find over a dozen bugs in my project.
After finding a bug, another issue I faced was determining why the bug was occurring and fixing it properly. This required me to have a very in-depth understanding of how my code worked, as well as utilising debugging tools to locate the cause of the bug. This meant that I was required to take my time coding and ensuring my code was not just fixing the current bug, but also not causing any additional bugs while attempting to fix them. Overall, I was able to fix every but I encountered and upon thoroughly testing the completed version of my task timer widget, I am unable to find any bugs.

I chose to create the Calendar Widget. I chose this widget in particular because after reading the project brief and looking through the list of suggested widgets I noted that I wanted to create something interesting whilst also giving myself a challenge. The Calendar widget stuck out to me as something that felt rather necessary for a task management website and I also believed that it would require an interesting approach to make it work, thus meeting my personally set requirements. And I was not let down, as it was such a fun problem to tackle.

I think the most challenging part of the project for me definitely revolved around using some of the already established code provided. I.e. searching through the provided code and finding the functionality that had already been created that I could use for my widget. This really gave me the perspective of what its like to be a developer that has come onboard to a project that had already been started and thus has to pickup from what had left off. Because of my struggles I actually ended up writing a custom section of code to retrieve the tasks and checked whether they were for a specific day, instead of using the prewritten, already-provided function of the same purpose. Another thing that challenged me during this project was my general code writing. 

I found my code had lots of iteration and conditionals that required a keen attention to detail to ensure that everything ran smoothly, correctly and efficiently, and so this really challenged my algorithm writing skills. Its for these reasons I had lots of fun with this project as it helped properly hone my coding skills.

My task for the web development group project was to create a Mood Widget. I am intrigued in creating the Mood Widget within the task management application as I wanted to create a function that is soft, something that is human emotional related amid the technical functionalities – timer, calendar and so on. As a person who has limited IT background, the process of making the Mood Widget was challenging but these challenges also improved my learning of web technology languages and my communication skill gained from doing this group project.
The challenge I faced at first was what designs I should choose for my Mood Widget. I went through various options of my widget designs by prototyping and testing the layout out, then finally I settled on those emoji icons that bring out the closeness for users. Hence, to place these emoji into my widget, I use flexbox in my CSS part to make the spacing between my emoji icons and the other widgets looks neat. Besides that, for the entire code to work well I also seek reference from other mood widget designs from other peers until my Mood Widget works. I also checked if there was an error in my code and fixed the issue as the first time when I ran the index.html my Mood Widget was not shown on the page.
In the end, this project has given me an opportunity to learn and explore the aspect of web technologies, improve my coding skills and that I can be a part of my group that I can contribute and grow.
